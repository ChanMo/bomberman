  <string name="levelspeech_4_1">Do you like spiders?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_5_1">Oh no! There is one of the orcs!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_5_2">We need to get the key from him.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_6_1">Interesting! These gems seem to strengthen my abilities greatly.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_6_2">Let's try to find more of them!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_7_1">There seems to be more orcs this way.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_7_2">It means we are on the right track.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_8_1">Uh oh! There's a bunch of spikes blocking our way to the door!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_8_2">We need to find a way to lower them!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_9_1">The TNT explosion destroys a 5x5 area! That's huge!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_10_1">Watch out for that big one!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_11_1">That lava looks hot.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_11_2">Maybe we shouldn't touch it.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_12_1">I wish I had more upgraded gems.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_13_1">Do I talk too much?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_14_1">Huh. Can you see that yucky slime?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_14_2">Let's blast it before it grows everywhere!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_15_1">These floating fires are weird. Maybe somebody created them?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_16_1">Tip: Try to change the equipped gems if a level is too hard.</string>

<!--
  <string name="levelspeech_16_1">Those TNTs sure are nice! KaBOOM!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_16_2">Have you already tried them?</string>
-->

  <string name="levelspeech_17_1">Have you ever wondered if the grass is greener outside the castle?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_18_1">Somebody sure has made a lot of bricks.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_18_2">It's okay though. I like blasting them.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_19_1">I heard they sell all kinds of hats in the customize shop.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_19_2">How unlucky that their helmets are only decorations.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_19_3">They are nice though.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_20_1">I once accidentally blew up a whole castle.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_20_2">"Accidentally"</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_21_1">It was a happy accident.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_22_1">My friend says he once found over 100 bombs from a castle!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_22_2">I don't believe him.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_23_1">Something green and big is approaching.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_23_2">Yuck, it looks gooey.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_24_1">Oh no, the big slime is here!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_24_2">Hurry up!! Let's go!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_25_1">Oh no, more slime!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_25_2">But hey..</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_25_3">Barrels and slime, my favorite combination!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_26_1">Whew, finally!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_26_2">No more slime!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_27_1">Bzz Bzz!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_28_1">Which route should we take?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_28_2">Top or bottom?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_29_1">I heard there might be a desert coming up soon.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_29_2">Maybe you should drink some water, just in case?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_30_1">Wow, that's scary! Should we run or blow it up?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_30_2">Just kidding, of course we run!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_30_3">...wait, there's no way back. Oops.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_31_1">Finally some more warmth!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_31_2">. . .</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_31_3">It's too hot in here.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_32_1">It's so hot my bombs think they already exploded.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_33_1">Think you could find some sunscreen lotion for me from the shop?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_34_1">Yay, more barrels!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_35_1">Cactuses, cactuses all around.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_36_1">Ruuuuun!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_37_1">The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the cactus.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_38_1">Down came the lava and washed the spider out.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_39_1">Something huge is rolling around nearby! I can feel it rumbling!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_40_1">What is huge and rolls over you?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_40_2">I don't know, but it looks super scary!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_41_1">Huh, that boss was tough! Great work defeating it!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_42_1">It's hard work blowing up all these cactuses.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_42_2">I'm all covered in cactus juice.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_43_1">Cactus, cactus, spiky cactus, delicious cactus.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_44_1">Did I already mention that there seems to be an abundance of cactuses around?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_45_1">Did I already mention that there seems to be an abundance of cactuses around?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_45_2">...wait, I said that already, didn't I? I think the heat is getting me.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_46_1">Let's hope it rains soon.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_47_1">I wanna see the cactuses bloom.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_48_1">Okay, okay, I'll shut up for a while.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_51_1">It sure is quiet around here.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_53_1">Could you get me some more bombs?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_53_2">It's nice to have lots of bombs.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_53_3">You never know when you need more.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_55_1">Three keys needed for one lock??</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_55_2">Are you kidding me? Who keeps making these strange doors?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_58_1">I'm hungry.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_58_2">Maybe we should grill some sausages in the lava. Or cactuses</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_59_1">I can feel the rumbling again! Better make yourself ready, they'll soon be here!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_60_1">Finally here! Let's blow those nasty monsters to smithereens!</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_10001_1">Wow, what is this place?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_10001_2">More skeletons are on the way from those portals!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_10001_3">Maybe they'll stop coming if we blow enough of them?</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_10002_1">It's those nasty portals again!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_10002_2">I wonder where those skeletons come from.</string>
    
  <string name="levelspeech_10003_1">Surprise! The portals are here again.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_10003_2">I think these monsters like to be predictable.</string>

  <string name="levelspeech_140_1">*BOOM* ..oops, our bombs awoke the dragon.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_140_2">Sorry.</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_141_1">Phew! That was a tough one.</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_152_1">I'm tired.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_152_2">It's important to take breaks once in a while if you feel tired.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_152_3">...or was it blowing up boxes? I always confuse the two.</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_153_1">Happiness is to have hot chocolate, fluffy socks,</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_153_2">and Big Bombs!</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_154_1">This level feels cold as ice!</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_155_1">...I wonder what happened here.</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_156_1">I sure would fancy a fresh orange or mango now!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_156_2">Or anything tropical.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_156_3">I wish these boxes had at least popsicles!</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_157_1">I'm hungryyyy</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_157_2">A gem for a hot meal! Anybody?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_157_3">Two gems?</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_157_4">Nah, I think the orcs are not interested. Shame.</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_158_1">I think it's slowly getting warmer.</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_158_2">Hurry up, I want to see what's coming up next!</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_159_1">Yay, I think there's some kind of a coast ahead!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_159_2">Surely it must be a more welcoming place than this one!</string>
  
  <string name="levelspeech_160_1">Wow, thats a big dragon!</string>
  <string name="levelspeech_160_2">It has such a huge tooth and mouth!</string>

  <string name="bomb_description_slimebomb">Spread slime everywhere with these gooey blasts! Upgrade for even more icky slime. Eww.</string>
  <string name="bomb_description_flashbang">Throw one of these and everyone nearby gets blinded in a flash (and a bang)! Be careful though as a blinded bomber can still be dangerous!</string>

  <string name="bomb_description_walldestroyer">The blast won't harm you or your opponents but it will clear out all the walls caught in it's blast. Renovating has never been this much fun!</string>
  <string name="bomb_description_throwablewall">Hurl a sturdy block of wall across the level. They shall not pass!</string>
  <string name="bomb_description_energyrecharge">Can't wait to use your powerups again? Make time fly with Cooldown Accelerator!</string>

  <string name="quest3speech_1_1">Yay! A winter wonderland!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_1_2">Let's go greet that snowman and see if it's friendly...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_1_3">My gems feel powerless in here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant1_1">Hello stranger!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant1_2">I made some snowballs. Do you need any?</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant1_3">You can use snowballs to toggle levers afar!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_2_1">Looks like I can do all kinds of stuff with snowballs...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_2_2">Let's see what we can do to that huge snowboulder!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant2_1">Hi again!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant2_2">I have more snowballs for you!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant2_3">If you can stop that boulder, you could probably push it to different direction...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_3_1">Looks like we have to tread carefully with those snowmans!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_3_2">There's no need to bomb them...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant3_1">Good job with those snow boulders!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant3_2">I'm glad my snowballs are useful!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant3_3">Be careful on that ice!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_4_1">I see some monsters trapped under the ice!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_4_2">It might be a good idea to free only those that are blocking the path...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant4_1">I heard there is an evil giant snowman somewhere in these lands!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant4_2">I hope we don't run into it!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant4_3">Although I bet you could easily blast it to pieces!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_5_1">There are some purple levers here...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_5_2">I wonder if those are connected to purple trapdoors...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant5_1">Whoah! Lots of snowmen here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant5_2">Let's play nice!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant5_3">Maybe my snowballs could help you with the situation?</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_6_1">What kind of flame is blue?</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_6_2">Really hot one, or really cold?</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_6_3">Either way, it's better to avoid those...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant6_1">More snowballs over here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant6_2">I wish I had hot chocolate...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant6_3">Laa-laa-laa! La-la-la-laa-laa-laa!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_7_1">Let's get some more snowballs from that merchant!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_7_2">I'm starting to like the snow! </string>
  <string name="quest3merchant7_1">Lots of trapdoors here...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant7_2">You could use some snowman's help!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant7_3">Better not to bomb it!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_8_1">So many snowmen here! We need to be careful where we place our bombs!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant8_1">Looks like you could use some snowballs again!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant8_2">Don't worry, I have plenty!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant8_3">Handcrafted to fit perfectly in your hand!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_9_1">So much ice...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_9_2">And I forgot my skates... Again!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant9_1">I cannot cross that ice with those monsters around...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant9_2">I'm just gonna stay here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant9_3">Be sure to check my ware though...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_10_1">A blue dragon!?</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_10_2">At Least we know now where those blue flames came from...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant10_1">This dragon is one of evil giant snowman's minions!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant10_2">I have some hearts for you!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant10_3">It's better to go prepared!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_11_1">So many trapdoors...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_11_2">Looks complicated, but let's get to it!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant11_1">Thanks for getting rid of that dragon!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant11_2">Now I can travel even further to sell my stuff...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant11_3">I found useful powerup! Come check it out!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_12_1">Yeah... More trapdoors...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant12_1">Be careful not to fall!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant12_2">Although, you can use these trapdoors against your enemies!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant12_3">I have some speed boosts, if you need...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_13_1">Our merchant friend is so far away this time...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_13_2">I guess we need to handle these monsters the old fashioned way!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant13_1">How did I get here?!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant13_2">I must've took the wrong turn somewhere...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant13_3">Anyway, come check out my ware!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_14_1">Where are these rolling snowballs coming from?</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant14_1">Beware of falling snow boulders!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant14_2">If you see a shadow on the ground, avoid it!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant14_3">I wouldn't want my best customer to get crushed...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_15_1">There are so many ice cubes blocking our way!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant15_1">More falling snow boulders here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant15_2">Be careful with your timing!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_16_1">That bridge looks dangerous...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_16_2">Better watch our steps!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant16_1">Maybe my speed boosts could help you here?</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant16_2">And couple of snowballs couldn't hurt...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_17_1">Looks like we can't just blast our way through with normal bombs this time...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_17_2">Maybe our friend merchant can help us!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant17_1">Come check out my new ware!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant17_2">I have some big booms that will definitely help you!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_18_1">I see some large snowball monsters waiting for us...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant18_1">Come get some snowballs before crossing those spikes!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant18_2">I think that route goes one way only...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_19_1">Looks like we need to push that snow boulder longer distance this time...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant19_1">Almost like those snow boulders had a mind of their own...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant19_2">I have some stuff that could help you with those!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_20_1">Ice giants and snow boulders...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_20_2">This looks dangerous!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant20_1">Help! I'm stuck here!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant20_2">I cannot get past these monsters!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_21_1">Oh no! Evil snowman trapped our merchant friend! We need to save her!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_21_2">Good thing I spared some snowballs from our earlier meetings...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant21_1">I got trapped here...</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant21_2">Keep pushing forward and you might find a way to free me!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_22_1">Time to blast our way through these monsters!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_23_1">Levers and snow boulders...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_23_2">I think it's a puzzle time!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_24_1">I see more blue flames...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_24_2">There just might be another dragon waiting for us...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_25_1">Dragons and giants?! Teaming up against us?!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_26_1">Too... much... snow...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_26_2">Could use some snowplow...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_27_1">I think we are getting closer to the giant evil snowman's hideout...</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_28_1">There she is! Time to save our friend from those evil ice giants!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant28_1">I managed to steal their keys!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_29_1">So many guards... I think that evil snowman is getting scared!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant29_1">Thank you for saving me!</string>
  <string name="quest3merchant29_2">Take these and blast your way forward!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_30_1">There that evil snowman is!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_30_2">And looks like it's having a bad hair day!</string>
  <string name="quest3speech_30_3">Time for a final snowdown!</string>

  <string name="winterquestunlocked">Winter Quest Unlocked!</string>
  
  <string name="CS0_1">The story begins in a small village, where our hero Bomber lives a peaceful life with many friends.</string>
  <string name="CS0_2">That was until one day the orcs attacked the village, and captured everyone.</string>
  <string name="CS0_3">Villagers were taken to the unknown lands, where they were separated from each other...</string>

  <string name="CS1_1">And so the evil Skeleton King fell, and the old wise Captain was rescued from imprisonment.</string>
  <string name="CS1_2">With the Captain's assistance, the Bomber was able to leave the plains behind.</string>
  <string name="CS1_3">As our Hero's journey continued towards the desert lands, a dark castle loomed in the distance.</string>
  
  <string name="CS2_1">Dark walls of the cursed castle was a menacing sight, but the Bomber knew that there was no time for hesitation.</string>
  <string name="CS2_2">Our Hero stepped inside the castle, and continued his travels determinedly towards the sounds of dragon roars.</string>
  
  <string name="CS3_1">Dragon after dragon fell before our Hero, and the curse of the castle started to disappear.</string>
  <string name="CS3_2">The King was freed from the dragon's control, but sadly this was not the end of the dragons.</string>
  <string name="CS3_3">There were more troubles ahead in the winter valley, where our Hero was headed next.</string>
  
  <string name="CS4_1">The King of Dragons was defeated, and winter valley was freed from its control.</string>
  <string name="CS4_2">The Dragon's demise caused a huge earthquake, and the frozen lake's thick ice was shattered.</string>
  <string name="CS4_3">For our Hero's surprise, there was a huge chasm under the ice.</string>
  <string name="CS4_4">There could be seen some sort of colonized underwater lands inside a huge bubble. Maybe a secret black market of some sort.</string>
  <string name="CS4_5">"Some of my friends could be trapped there" the Bomber tought, and jumped into the bubble.</string>
  
  <string name="CS5_1">The zombie merchants were arrested and brought to justice. The whole underwater black market was shut down soon after the event.</string>
  <string name="CS5_2">The Bomber's short rest was interrupted fast by a request of help from a friendly Robot Merchant.</string>
  <string name="CS5_3">The Robot Tyrant had taken control of the whole robot world by force. It was time to get up and continue the journey.</string>
  
  <string name="CS6_1">The Robot Tyrant's dynasty came to an end, and caused the virus program to get purged from the hostile robots.</string>
  <string name="CS6_2">The robots turned friendly one by one, and the robot world was free again.</string>
  <string name="CS6_3">After the decisive victory, the Bomber realized something important... </string>
  <string name="CS6_4">The Skeleton King, dragons, zombie merchants and the Robot Tyrant were all under some kind of magic that was causing them to act hostile.</string>
  <string name="CS6_5">It was time to end this madness, and our Hero headed towards the land of magic...</string>
  <string name="CS6_6">The Medieval Kingdom. The world that was locked into medieval times with strong magic.</string>

  <string name="CS7_1">Hello Bomber! I haven't seen you around here.</string>
  <string name="CS7_2">Something strange is happening here... I have seen some snowmen go absolutely mental.</string>
  <string name="CS7_3">Anyways, take care now, and have some fun with the snow!</string>
    
  <string name="CS8_1">Hello human! I'm happy that you came to our island!</string>
  <string name="CS8_2">The Robot Overlord is planning on something, and it can't be good!</string>
  <string name="CS8_3">Your bombs look powerful! You could probably prevent the Robot Overlord's plans!</string>
  
  <string name="CS9_1">Help! Help! My mother and father have been kidnapped!</string>
  <string name="CS9_2">Some evil knights came out of nowhere, and took over our lands!</string>
  <string name="CS9_3">You look like a friendly and very capable person, could you please help?!</string>
  
  <string name="CS10_1">Howdy there Bomber! Thank you for freeing me. I could have some more work for you.</string>
  <string name="CS10_2">There are many nasties in the world, and I would happily pay you some gold to get rid of them.</string>
  <string name="CS10_3">How about it? Come visit me for more information on the latest sightings.</string>

  <string name="CS11_1">Ahoy matey! Thank you for freeing me!</string>
  <string name="CS11_2">I've heard there's some trouble at the Winter Island...</string>
  <string name="CS11_3">Thanks to your heroic deeds, I can now safely sail there.</string>
  
  <string name="CS12_1">Ahoy matey! Thanks for getting rid of those monsters! Now I can safely dock here.</string>
  <string name="CS12_2">If you ever want to visit the nearby Robot Island, I'd be happy to take you there.</string>
  <string name="CS12_3">There might even be some work for a skilled Bomber like you!</string>
  
  <string name="CS13_1">Ahoy matey! During my sails, I've discovered an island that is still stuck in medieval times!</string>
  <string name="CS13_2">I wonder what kind of treasures you could find there.</string>
  <string name="CS13_3">I can take you to the island now that you have broken the Castle's curse.</string>

  <!-- World screen friend speeches -->
  <string name="CS15_1">That gem you found is enchanted! It happens to be that I have actually studied how to use those enchanted gems.</string> 
  <string name="CS15_2">Equipping gems strengthens your bombing abilities! It is a good idea to check your equipped gems every now and then.</string>
  <string name="CS15_3">We can do a lot of cool stuff with gems, so let's find more of those!</string>

  <string name="CS16_1">I can sell you some additional powerups at level entrances. I call them "Helpers". Those can help you get through some harder stages.</string>
  <string name="CS16_2">Where do I get them? Man gotta have some connections you know.</string>
  <string name="CS16_3">Those dynamites are handmade though. I hate bomb explosion power regulation laws...</string>

  <string name="CS17_1">These plains used to be a quiet and peaceful place... but that all changed when the orcs came.</string>
  <string name="CS17_2">During the invasion they broke free some of the worst outlaws these lands have ever known.</string>
  <string name="CS17_3">I can pay you some gold if you help me to make these lands a safer place to live again.</string>
  <string name="CS17_4">That Skeleton King is one of their leaders. Why skeletons and orcs are working together? Your guess is as good as mine.</string>
  
  <string name="CS18_1">Quests are smaller special tasks, where you can gain glimpses of the future worlds to come.</string>
  <string name="CS18_2">Quests have their own progression and rewards. You can play them whenever you want after you have unlocked them.</string>
  <string name="CS18_3">Quests can be harder than the normal levels that you are currently progressing. Gems can't be used to boost your stats in quests.</string>

  <string name="CS19_1">I just graduated from the Academy of Bombers! Isn't it fascinating to study how everything works?</string>
  <string name="CS19_2">Those desert orcs you have seen here, are under the command of the dragons.</string>
  <string name="CS19_3">It seems that they are defending the great castle behind the desert.</string>
  <string name="CS19_4">Rumor has it those dragons have actually cursed the whole castle.</string>
  <string name="CS19_5">If you're going there, you must take me with you! I want to see it with my own eyes!</string>

  <string name="CS20_1">I see you have been gaining some rank already. That is good!</string>
  <string name="CS20_2">Lately I have been training my skills in the Arena. There you can compete against the greatest Bombers of the world.</string>
  <string name="CS20_3">You still have a long road ahead of you, but with training you can do anything you want!</string>

  <string name="CS21_1">Oh my... this is bad. The whole castle has gone insane. There are undead everywhere!</string>
  <string name="CS21_2">The dragons are behind this whole thing. You need to defeat them before the whole castle is in ruins.</string>
  <string name="CS21_3">Why did those dragons come to my castle of all the possible castles...</string>

  <string name="CS22_1">Yeah yeah, I know that I look kinda different than other Bombers around here. I don't understand why everybody should look the same.</string>
  <string name="CS22_2">You can also customize your looks in the character customization. It is actually kinda fun!</string>

  <string name="CS23_1">This winter valley was originally an ideal place for travellers to experience the winter wonder land. It was a place of happiness and joy.</string>
  <string name="CS23_2">That came to an end when the King of Dragons came with the orcs. The Dragon's influence have even changed the orcs to look cold.</string>
  <string name="CS23_3">Nowadays the place is a one big cold warehouse. Who knows what they are even storing here...</string>

  <string name="CS24_1">I travelled here to see the big frozen lake, but instead I got trapped by the ice orcs!</string>
  <string name="CS24_2">If you hadn't freed me, I would have been frozen for good anytime soon...</string>
  <string name="CS24_3">You stay warm now!</string>

  <string name="CS25_1">I came here to investigate these merchants undercover.</string>
  <string name="CS25_2">Do you think it was my outfit that blew my cover?</string>
  <string name="CS25_3">Anyways, thanks for freeing me. I can report my findings now to my superiors.</string>

  <string name="CS26_1">I love to swim and dive! I just think I came too far this time...</string>
  <string name="CS26_2">I accidentally went through that portal and ended up only deeper.</string>
  <string name="CS26_3">You can probably go back to another part of this world through it.</string>

  <string name="CS27_1">I'm glad that you're here! Someone is uploading virus programs to all friendly robots at the factories!</string>
  <string name="CS27_2">Now they are all hostile and building a massive robot army!</string>
  <string name="CS27_3">I'll follow you through these factories and assist any way I can!</string>
  
  <string name="CS28_1">Thank you for freeing me! Those knights turned hostile all of a sudden!</string>
  <string name="CS28_2">I heard their king might be hiding in the same kind of armor as regular knights.</string>
  <string name="CS28_3">I just don't know which one he is, there are so many. Could you bomb them all just to be sure?</string>

  <string name="CS29_1">I came here to study medieval magic, but everything seems to be cursed.</string>
  <string name="CS29_2">I'm going to stay here and study this curse.</string>
  <string name="CS29_3">Maybe I can find a way to lift it.</string>

  <string name="CS30_1">Next level is marked as a hard level. Good luck mate!</string>
  
  <string name="CS31_1">Hello there! I have been studying our gems and I have found a way to fuse them to even a better quality!</string>
  <string name="CS31_2">Those gems contains new ability to pierce trough blocks. Isn't that nice!</string>
  
  <string name="CS32_1">Breaking news! I have found a way to fuse our gems to even better quality! We can get even more power now!</string>

  <string name="CS33_1">You have done a solid job lad! I'm impressed on how you have handled those bounties and I think it's time to raise the bar.</string>
  <string name="CS33_2">I have now added two star bounties to your hunt list. Happy hunting!</string>

  <string name="CS34_1">Wow! Very nice! I think you are ready to face the worst of the worst outlaws now.</string>
  <string name="CS34_2">I have now added three star bounties to your hunt list. Good luck!</string>

  <string name="CS35_1">Ahoy matey! There is some trouble at the paradise and your presence is required!</string>
  <string name="CS35_2">So put on your swimsuit and let's set our sails towards the Tropical Island!</string>

  <string name="CS36_1">Hey dude! Awesome to see you here! We tried to throw an epic party at this island, but ran into some trouble...</string>
  <string name="CS36_2">There's something wrong with the local tribe. They used to be really peaceful.</string>
  <string name="CS36_3">Some of our crew went to investigate deeper into the jungle, but haven't come back. Maybe you could check it out?</string>
  <string name="CS36_4">I'll just stay here at the beach and practice my dance moves!</string>

  <string name="CS38_1">Hello there! I traveled here to study the Tribesmen's evil power!</string>
  <string name="CS38_2">I think I have located the source of their power!</string>
  <string name="CS38_3">There is a some sort of rift in spacetime, and it's mixing an evil reality with this one!</string>
  <string name="CS38_4">You could probably travel to that dimension by jumping to the rift. I cannot guarantee your safety though!</string>
  <string name="CS38_5">Good luck, if you are going to try it!</string>

  <string name="dontjumpdown1">Whoah! We are so high!</string>
  <string name="dontjumpdown2">Phew, almost fell down.</string>
  <string name="dontjumpdown3">I can see so far from up here.</string>

  <string name="quest4speech_1_1">Time to hit the beach!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_2_1">Looks like we have to find more floating leaves...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_2_2">I feel a bit hesitant about crossing those waters...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_2_3">I guess we have to do it, if we want to keep the party going!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_3_1">Whoah, we are in the jungle now!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_3_2">I wonder what kind of nasty creatures we can find in here?</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_4_1">Lots of water here...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_4_2">Let's think carefully where to place leaves!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_5_1">Yikes, I feel the earth rumbling!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_5_2">It must be those rolling rocks...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_5_3">Let's try not to get squashed!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_6_1">It's getting really sweaty in here!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_6_2">I should shop for some lighter clothing...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_7_1">Weather's a bit cloudy...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_7_2">With a chance of falling rocks!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_8_1">When will this jungle end? I wanna go back to the beach!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_8_2">Hopefully really soon...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_9_1">I can hear some faint buzzing...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_9_2">I'm not sure if I wanna know what it is...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_10_1">The buzzing intensifies...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_10_2">Whatever it is, it's big!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_11_1">There are some ramps leading to higher ground here!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_11_2">Hopefully you are not afraid of heights?</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_12_1">Yay, we're back at the beach!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_12_2">Too bad those evil tribesmen have taken all the best spots!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_12_3">They have even put some nasty spike traps here!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_13_1">I just wanted to work on my tan...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_13_2">But all of the beach is conquered by the monsters!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_14_1">This beach belongs to the people who just want to chill!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_14_2">We need to claim it back!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_15_1">Climbing these ramps is a good workout!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_15_2">We'll get strong legs and can run away from monsters faster...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_16_1">I wanna make sandcastles!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_16_2">But those tribesmen would probably destroy them...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_17_1">Remember to drink water!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_17_2">It's important to stay hydrated!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_18_1">Have you noticed that there are different types of tribesmen?</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_18_2">They all seem to have a bit different set of skills...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_19_1">Aaand we're back in the jungle!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_19_2">This jungle certainly doesn't have any fun and games...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_20_1">I have this weird tingling sensation...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_20_2">As if I have spiders all over me...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_21_1">We need to find some throwable bombs to reach those switches...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_21_2">Let's think carefully where to throw...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_22_1">RUUUN!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_23_1">I don't know which one I hate more, spikes or water...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_24_1">There's a long climb ahead...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_24_2">Gotta do the work if we wanna reach the top!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_25_1">I could learn to swim, but I'm too busy blasting monsters!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_25_2">That is definitely not an excuse, but the truth...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_26_1">Tribesmen must know we're coming for them...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_26_2">They have laid so many spike traps for us!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_26_3">How thoughtful of them...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_27_1">Where are all the hula dancers?</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_27_2">I thought tropical islands are supposed to have those?</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_28_1">Whoah! I think I see a volcano far away in the horizon!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_28_2">I wonder if we can explore that someday in the future...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_29_1">We must be getting closer to the top...</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_29_2">We just have to think this puzzle through carefully!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_30_1">At last we're at the top!</string>
  <string name="quest4speech_30_2">Now let's see who's in charge of this mess!</string>

  <string name="quest4merchant1_1">Welcome to the beach my friend!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant1_2">Do you want to see something cool?</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant1_3">Floating leaves can be used to get across the water!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant1_4">You can find floating leaves by blasting stuff!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant1_5">See you later mate! Time to party!</string>

  <string name="quest4merchant11_1">Whoah! How did I get up here?!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant11_2">Hey, I can see a switch over there!</string>

  <string name="quest4merchant11_4">There we go! Let's keep the party going!</string>

  <string name="quest4merchant21_1">That guardian can block explosions with a shield!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant21_2">Maybe I can do something about it...</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant21_3">Let's see how you like this?!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant21_4">Ka-boooom! Bye-bye shield!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant21_5">Try to blast these guardians from behind...</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant21_6">Party on dude!</string>

  <string name="quest4merchant30_1">Nice job mate!</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant30_2">That Tribe Boss was talking about the great one. I wonder who that is...</string>
  <string name="quest4merchant30_3">Anyway, you probably stopped the great one's plans!</string>
